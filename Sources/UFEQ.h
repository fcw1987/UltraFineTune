 * Bypass smoothly removes the tone filters, retaining output trim and
 * the headroom attenuation associated with the selected tone settings.
 * Filter history stays active during bypass for a smooth return.
 *
 * Automatic headroom samples the combined frequency response, offsets any
 * estimated boost, and adds 1 dB for a nonflat curve. It reduces overload
 * risk but is not a bound on arbitrary waveform peaks, a lookahead limiter,
 * or intersample peak protection. A final sample clamp prevents values
